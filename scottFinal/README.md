# Final Project  
### CIT-130
1. If not already installed, install Python 3 and Pip
 (Pip is more than likely already included in your Python installation)

2. In the terminal, run:  
```
pip install pipenv
```
3. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing the .py file included in my project.  

4. In the terminal, run:  
```
pipenv install mysql.connector
```    
5. In the terminal, run (This should run the python file and populate the database):  
```
pipenv run python mysqltesting.py
```  
-If this doesn't work it is possible that there are multiple installations of python on this machine.  Try running:  
```pipenv run python3 mysqltesting.py
```
